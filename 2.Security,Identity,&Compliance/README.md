## Basic level

- AWS General Immersion Day: IAM Basic
  - Launch EC2 Instances with Tags  
    To run 2 instances we need to enter [EC2 Dashboard](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:) and click on *Launch instances* and select instance type.
    ![EC2 Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61629889/229584539-890d229f-36f8-439f-84f7-0e673fff14a5.png)

  - Create AWS IAM Identities
    - Create IAM Policy to attach to IAM User group  
      Go to [IAM dashboard](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/home), then *Account Alias*.
      ![IAM dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61629889/229593966-98eb0f9e-4698-4705-9f16-45c4365a5a4f.png)
      Next step is creating [policy](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/policies):

      ```json
      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "ec2:*",
                  "Resource": "*",
                  "Condition": {
                      "StringEquals": {
                          "ec2:ResourceTag/Env": "dev"
                      }
                  }
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
                  "Resource": "*"
              },
              {
                  "Effect": "Deny",
                  "Action": [
                      "ec2:DeleteTags",
                      "ec2:CreateTags"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "*"
              }
          ]
      }
      ```
      Success! The policy DevPolicy has been created.

    - Create IAM User group named dev-group  
      Heading to the [User groups](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/groups), name it and attach DevPolicy
      dev-group user group created.
    - Create IAM User which name is dev-user placed in dev-group  
      In IAM tab click [Users](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users) and create the user with the name *dev-user* and pick **I want to create an IAM user** and add him to the *dev-group* just created on the next step.

      Now Vasia can stop DEV instance (Successfully stopped i-0174049baeff9a392), but PROD can't (Failed to stop the instance i-018751259dc5b6f40)

  - Assign IAM Role for EC2 Instance and Test the access  
  To create S3 Bucket, enter into the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/get-started) . And then, click **Create bucket** button

  Move on to the IAM - Roles - Create role - AWS service - EC2 and create policy like we did before.  

  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
          "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:Get*",
                  "s3:List*"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::iam-test-user_name/*",
                  "arn:aws:s3:::iam-test-user_name"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }  
  ```
  The policy IAMBucketTestPolicy has been created. Then back to the previous tab and proceed with role *IAMBucketTestRole* creation.
  Role IAMBucketTestRole created.
  !!Check you–∫ Security Group to avoid connection issues!!  

  ```bash  
  [ec2-user@ip-172-31-27-15 ~]$ aws s3 ls  
  Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".  
  ```  

  Update your IAM role: Back to the Instances page and select prod-instance. Click Actions button and select Security and click Modify IAM role. 
In IAM role, select *IAMBucketTestRole* and click Save button to attach IAM role to EC2 instance.
